- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbundantMichaela
- 👀 I’m interested in ColdFusion, business intuiton and travel. I founded a ColdFusion software development agency, TeraTech, in 1989, before CF even existed. :-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for fun. Sometimes on a Raspberry Pi calculating digits of Pi. Because I love math as well as code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CF open source and interview other CFers on my podcast. And for articles and books related to CF.
